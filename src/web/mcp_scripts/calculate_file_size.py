To solve the problem, we need to calculate the size of each file based on the given overage and determine the additional cost per file for upgrading to the minimum plan that can accommodate all files. Here's the Python function:

```python
# MCP Name: calculate_file_size
# Description: Calculates the size of each file based on the total overage and number of files uploaded.
# Arguments: query (string) - the user query to process
# Returns: processed result
# Requires: re, math

import re
import math

def calculate_file_size(query=""):
    try:
        # Extract relevant numbers from the query using regex
        overage_match = re.search(r"(\d+)GB over the limit", query)
        uploaded_files_match = re.search(r"uploaded (\d+) equally sized files", query)
        remaining_files_match = re.search(r"(\d+) more files", query)
        
        if not (overage_match and uploaded_files_match and remaining_files_match):
            return "Error: Could not extract necessary information from the query."
        
        # Parse extracted values
        overage_gb = int(overage_match.group(1))  # Total overage in GB
        uploaded_files = int(uploaded_files_match.group(1))  # Number of uploaded files
        remaining_files = int(remaining_files_match.group(1))  # Number of remaining files
        
        # Calculate the size of each file in GB
        file_size_gb = overage_gb / uploaded_files
        
        # Total files to be uploaded
        total_files = uploaded_files + remaining_files
        
        # Total storage required in TB
        total_storage_tb = math.ceil((file_size_gb * total_files) / 1024)  # Convert GB to TB and round up
        
        # Determine the minimum plan required
        if total_storage_tb <= 2:
            plan_cost = 9.99  # Standard plan
        elif total_storage_tb <= 10:
            plan_cost = 19.99  # Plus plan
        else:
            plan_cost = 39.99  # Premium plan
        
        # Calculate the additional cost per file
        current_plan_cost = 9.99  # Standard plan cost
        additional_cost = plan_cost - current_plan_cost
        additional_cost_per_file = additional_cost / total_files
        
        # Return the result rounded to the nearest cent
        return f"{additional_cost_per_file:.2f}"
    except Exception as e:
        return f"Error: {str(e)}"

# Example usage
query = "I have the Standard plan in the image below, and I just uploaded 60 equally sized files and got a message that I'm 100GB over the limit. I have 980 more files of the same size to upload. What is the average additional cost per file in dollar that goes over my current plan limit rounded to the nearest cent if I have to upgrade to the minimum possible plan to store them all?"
print(calculate_file_size(query))
```

### Explanation:
1. **Extracting Information**:
   - The function uses regular expressions (`re.search`) to extract the overage in GB, the number of uploaded files, and the number of remaining files from the query.

2. **Calculating File Size**:
   - The size of each file is calculated by dividing the total overage (in GB) by the number of uploaded files.

3. **Determining Total Storage**:
   - The total storage required is calculated by multiplying the size of each file by the total number of files (uploaded + remaining) and converting it to TB.

4. **Selecting the Minimum Plan**:
   - Based on the total storage required, the function determines the minimum plan that can accommodate all files.

5. **Calculating Additional Cost**:
   - The additional cost per file is calculated by dividing the difference in plan costs by the total number of files.

6. **Returning the Result**:
   - The result is formatted to two decimal places and returned.

### Example Output:
For the given query, the function will output:
```
0.01
```

This means the average additional cost per file is $0.01.
