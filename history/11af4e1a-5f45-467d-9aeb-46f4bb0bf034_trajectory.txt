Question: How many more blocks (also denoted as layers) in BERT base encoder than the encoder from the architecture proposed in Attention is All You Need?
Level: 1

Let me think through this step by step:

🧠 **Coordinator:** The user query requires a comparison between the number of encoder blocks in BERT base and the encoder from the 'Attention is All You Need' architecture. This information is likely available in research papers, documentation, or reliable online sources. Since no relevant information has been retrieved yet, a targeted web search focusing on the architectures of BERT base and the original Transformer model is the best next step.🎯 **Strategy:** targeted search💡 **Missing:** Exact number of encoder blocks in BERT base and the original Transformer model from 'Attention is All You Need'.→ Routing to web_agent✅ coordinator completed
🌐 **Web Agent:** Performing 3 TARGETED searches🎯 **Focus:** Exact number of encoder blocks in BERT base and the original Transformer model from 'Attention is All You Need'.🔍 **Search 1 (Original):** number of encoder layers in BERT base model vs Attention is All You Need Transfo...   → Found 2 results🔍 **Search 2 (Focused):** BERT base architecture encoder blocks compared to original Transformer paper   → Found 2 results🔍 **Search 3 (Focused):** how many layers in BERT base encoder and Attention is All You Need Transformer encoder   → Found 2 results📋 **Total unique results:** 6✅ web_agent completed
✅ evaluator completed
🧠 **Coordinator:** The query is straightforward and asks for a comparison of the number of encoder layers between BERT base and the original Transformer architecture from 'Attention is All You Need.' The search results already provide the necessary information: BERT base has 12 encoder layers, while the original Transformer has 6 encoder layers. This makes BERT base's encoder twice as deep. No further searches, tools, or visual analysis are required.→ Routing to synthesizer✅ coordinator completed
