Question: In NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day on 2006 January 21, two astronauts are visible, with one appearing much smaller than the other. As of August 2023, out of the astronauts in the NASA Astronaut Group that the smaller astronaut was a member of, which one spent the least time in space, and how many minutes did he spend in space, rounded to the nearest minute? Exclude any astronauts who did not spend any time in space. Give the last name of the astronaut, separated from the number of minutes by a semicolon.
Level: 3

Let me think through this step by step:

🖼️ **Vision enabled:** 1 images detected🧠 **Coordinator:** The user query requires identifying specific astronauts and their time spent in space, which involves historical and factual data. While an image is provided, it does not appear directly relevant to the query about astronaut groups or time spent in space. A web search is the most appropriate next step to gather information about the NASA Astronaut Group associated with the smaller astronaut in the 2006 APOD image and determine which member spent the least time in space.🎯 **Strategy:** targeted search💡 **Missing:** Details about the NASA Astronaut Group associated with the smaller astronaut in the 2006 APOD image and the time spent in space by its members.→ Routing to web_agent✅ coordinator completed

🖼️ **Vision enabled:** 1 images detected🧠 **Coordinator:** The query requires identifying the astronaut who spent the least time in space from NASA Astronaut Group 3, which includes Charles 'Pete' Conrad, the smaller astronaut in the image. The search results provide detailed information about Apollo 12 and its crew, including their spaceflight durations. No additional searches or tools are needed as the information is comprehensive and directly addresses the query.→ Routing to synthesizer✅ coordinator completed
