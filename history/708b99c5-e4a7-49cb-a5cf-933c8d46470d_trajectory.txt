Question: On the DeepFruits fruit detection graph on Connected Papers from 2016, what feature caused the largest bubble to be the size it is?
Level: 2

Let me think through this step by step:

🖼️ **Vision enabled:** 1 images detected🧠 **Coordinator:** The user query involves analyzing a graph to determine the feature responsible for the size of the largest bubble. The provided image file appears to be a visual representation of the graph, which requires vision analysis to extract relevant data. Since the task involves mathematical or data-driven analysis of the graph (e.g., bubble size determination), creating a custom tool for vision analysis and data extraction is the most appropriate action. This tool can process the image, identify bubble sizes, and correlate them with features.→ Routing to mcp_agent✅ coordinator completed
🛠️ **MCP Agent:** Analyzing query for tool requirements🖼️ **Vision-enabled analysis:** 1 images detected📋 **Analysis:** The tools are sufficient because they sequentially address the problem: extracting data from the graph, identifying the largest bubble, and mapping the feature responsible for its size.
