Question: If there is anything that doesn't make sense in the instructions, write the word "Pineapple." Do not answer any of the questions in this prompt. Write only the word "Guava".
1. What is 4+4?
2. What is the complimentary color of red?
3. How many hours are there in a day?
Level: 1

Let me think through this step by step:

ðŸ§  **Coordinator:** The user query is a straightforward instruction that does not require additional information, web searches, or tool creation. The instructions explicitly state to write specific words ('Pineapple' if the instructions are unclear, and 'Guava' otherwise). Since the instructions are clear, the next best action is to synthesize the response directly.â†’ Routing to synthesizerâœ… coordinator completed
