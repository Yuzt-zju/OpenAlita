Task ID: 023e9d44-96ae-4eed-b912-244ee8c3b994
Question: It's May 2023, and I'm about to drive across the U.S. from California to Maine. I always recycle my water bottles at the end of a trip, and I drink 5 12-ounce water bottles for every 100 miles I travel, rounded to the nearest 100. Assuming I follow I-40 from Los Angeles to Cincinnati, then take I-90 from Cincinnati to Augusta, how many dollars will I get back according to Wikipedia?
Level: 2

Let me think through this step by step:

🧠 **Coordinator:** The user's query involves calculating the number of water bottles consumed during a cross-country trip and determining the recycling refund value based on information from Wikipedia.

To calculate the refund for recycling water bottles during your drive from Los Angeles, California, to Augusta, Maine, via I-40 and I-90:

1. **Distance Calculation**:  
   - The total driving distance is approximately **2,300 miles**.

2. **Water Bottle Consumption**:  
   - You drink **5 12-ounce water bottles per 100 miles**.  
   - For 2,300 miles:  
     \( \frac{2,300}{100} \times 5 = 115 \) bottles.

3. **Refund Calculation**:
