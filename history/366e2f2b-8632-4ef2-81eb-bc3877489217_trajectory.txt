🧠 **Coordinator:** The user query involves analyzing an attached file to determine the best accommodation for a family that enjoys swimming and wants a full house. Since no image files were detected and no web search results are available, the next best action is to create a custom tool to process and analyze the attached file. This will allow us to extract relevant information about accommodations, such as swimming facilities and full-house availability, and make a recommendation.→ Routing to mcp_agent✅ coordinator completed
