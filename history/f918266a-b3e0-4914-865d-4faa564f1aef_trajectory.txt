Let me think through this step by step:

🧠 **Coordinator:** The user query involves determining the final numeric output of a Python code snippet. Since no image files or attached code are detected, and there are no web search results or prior actions to analyze, the best course of action is to create a custom tool to simulate or execute the Python code. This will allow us to directly compute the output and provide an accurate answer. Vision analysis is not required as there is no image or visual content to process.→ Routing to mcp_agent✅ coordinator completed
🛠️ **MCP Agent:** Analyzing query for tool requirements📋 **Analysis:** The query requires determining the final numeric output of the attached Python code. A single tool, `execute_python_code`, is sufficient to parse, execute, and return the result. No additional tools are needed as the task is straightforward and focused on code execution.🔧 **Strategy:** sequential execution🛠️ **Tools needed:** 1🆕 **Creating 1 new tools...**🔧 **Creating:** execute_python_code   ✅ Registered: execute_python_code⚡ **Executing tools sequentially...**🔍 **Executing:** execute_python_code   → Success: Function 'execute_python_code' executed successful...📊 **Registry status:** 1 total tools available✅ mcp_agent completed
