Question: In July 2, 1959 United States standards for grades of processed fruits, vegetables, and certain other products listed as dehydrated, consider the items in the "dried and dehydrated section" specifically marked as dehydrated along with any items in the Frozen/Chilled section that contain the whole name of the item, but not if they're marked Chilled. As of August 2023, what is the percentage (to the nearest percent) of those standards that have been superseded by a new version since the date given in the 1959 standards?
Level: 3

Let me think through this step by step:

🧠 **Coordinator:** The user's query requires historical and current information about U.S. standards for grades of processed fruits, vegetables, and other products. Since no relevant information has been retrieved yet, a web search is the most appropriate next step to gather data on the 1959 standards, their updates, and the percentage of those standards that have been superseded. This will help determine the necessary context for further analysis or calculations.🎯 **Strategy:** targeted search💡 **Missing:** Details about the 1959 standards for processed fruits and vegetables, their updates, and the percentage of those standards that have been superseded as of August 2023.→ Routing to web_agent✅ coordinator completed
