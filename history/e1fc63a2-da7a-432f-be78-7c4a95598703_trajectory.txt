Question: If Eliud Kipchoge could maintain his record-making marathon pace indefinitely, how many thousand hours would it take him to run the distance between the Earth and the Moon its closest approach? Please use the minimum perigee value on the Wikipedia page for the Moon when carrying out your calculation. Round your result to the nearest 1000 hours and do not use any comma separators if necessary.
Level: 1

Let me think through this step by step:

🧠 **Coordinator:** The query requires specific numerical data: the minimum perigee distance between the Earth and the Moon, which is not provided in the current context. This information is essential to perform the calculation. A web search is the most efficient way to retrieve this data, as it is likely available on reliable sources like Wikipedia or scientific references. Once the distance is obtained, a calculation tool can be created to determine the time required based on Eliud Kipchoge's marathon pace.🎯 **Strategy:** targeted search💡 **Missing:** The minimum perigee distance between the Earth and the Moon.→ Routing to web_agent✅ coordinator completed
