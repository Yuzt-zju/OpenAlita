Question: In the endnote found in the second-to-last paragraph of page 11 of the book with the doi 10.2307/j.ctv9b2xdv, what date in November was the Wikipedia article accessed? Just give the day of the month.
Level: 2

Let me think through this step by step:

🖼️ **Vision enabled:** 1 images detected🧠 **Coordinator:** The query requires extracting specific textual information (a date in November) from an endnote in the second-to-last paragraph of page 11 of a book. An image file is available, which likely contains the relevant information. Vision analysis, specifically OCR (Optical Character Recognition), is needed to extract text from the image. Creating a custom tool for OCR will allow us to process the image and retrieve the required date efficiently.→ Routing to mcp_agent✅ coordinator completed

🖼️ **Vision enabled:** 1 images detected🧠 **Coordinator:** The user query requires extracting specific information from an endnote in the second-to-last paragraph of page 11 of a book. The image file provided likely contains the relevant text, but the OCR tool failed due to missing dependencies (Tesseract not installed). Creating a custom tool or resolving the OCR issue is necessary to extract the required information from the image. Other agents like browser automation or web search are not suitable since the query is focused on analyzing the provided image file.→ Routing to mcp_agent✅ coordinator completed

🖼️ **Vision enabled:** 1 images detected🧠 **Coordinator:** The query requires extracting specific text information (a date) from an endnote in the provided image file. The error from the previous OCR attempt indicates that Tesseract is not installed or configured properly. To proceed, we need to create or use an alternative OCR tool or vision analysis method to extract the text from the image. This is a straightforward image-based task that does not require interaction or authentication.→ Routing to mcp_agent✅ coordinator completed

📊 **Evaluator:** The available information does not include the text of the second-to-last paragraph on page 11 or the content of the associated endnote. Without this, it is impossible to determine the date in November when the Wikipedia article was accessed. Additional efforts are needed to retrieve the relevant book content or endnote details.
