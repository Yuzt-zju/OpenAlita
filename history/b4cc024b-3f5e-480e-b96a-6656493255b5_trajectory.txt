Question: The photograph in the Whitney Museum of American Art's collection with accession number 2022.128 shows a person holding a book. Which military unit did the author of this book join in 1813? Answer without using articles.
Level: 2

Let me think through this step by step:

🖼️ **Vision enabled:** 1 images detected🧠 **Coordinator:** The query requires identifying the author of the book depicted in the photograph and determining the military unit they joined in 1813. Since the image file is available, vision analysis is necessary to extract text or details from the image (e.g., book title or author name). This information can then be used to perform a targeted web search or synthesis. Creating a custom OCR tool will allow us to extract text from the image efficiently.→ Routing to mcp_agent✅ coordinator completed
🛠️ **MCP Agent:** Analyzing query for tool requirements🖼️ **Vision-enabled analysis:** 1 images detected📋 **Analysis:** The query requires identifying the book in the photograph and determining its author's military affiliation in 1813. First, metadata from the museum's collection will provide context about the photograph. If the metadata lacks sufficient detail, text extraction from the image will help identify the book. Finally, searching for the author's historical background will reveal the military unit they joined in 1813. These tools are sufficient and non-redundant.🔧 **Strategy:** sequential execution🛠️ **Tools needed:** 3✅ **Found existing tool:** fetch_museum_metadata✅ **Found existing tool:** search_book_author🆕 **Creating 1 new tools...**🔧 **Creating:** extract_text_from_image   ✅ Registered: extract_text_from_image⚡ **Executing tools sequentially...**🔍 **Executing:** fetch_museum_metadata   → Failed: fetch_museum_metadata() takes from 0 to 1 positional arguments but 3 were given🔍 **Executing:** extract_text_from_image   → Success: Error: tesseract is not installed or it's not in y...🔍 **Executing:** search_book_author   → Failed: search_book_author() takes from 0 to 1 positional arguments but 2 were given📊 **Registry status:** 3 total tools available✅ mcp_agent completed

🖼️ **Vision enabled:** 1 images detected🧠 **Coordinator:** The query requires extracting text from the image file to identify the book's author and subsequently determine the military unit they joined in 1813. Since OCR tools are not installed, creating a custom tool for text extraction or vision analysis is necessary. This step will address the missing information and enable further research or synthesis.→ Routing to mcp_agent✅ coordinator completed
🛠️ **MCP Agent:** Analyzing query for tool requirements🖼️ **Vision-enabled analysis:** 1 images detected📋 **Analysis:** The query requires identifying the book in the photograph and determining its author's military history. First, metadata from the museum's collection is fetched to gather details about the photograph. If the metadata does not provide sufficient information, text extraction from the image is used to identify the book or author. Finally, the author's military history is searched to answer the query.🔧 **Strategy:** sequential execution🛠️ **Tools needed:** 3✅ **Found existing tool:** fetch_museum_metadata✅ **Found existing tool:** extract_text_from_image🆕 **Creating 1 new tools...**🔧 **Creating:** search_author_military_history   ✅ Registered: search_author_military_history⚡ **Executing tools sequentially...**🔍 **Executing:** fetch_museum_metadata   → Failed: fetch_museum_metadata() takes from 0 to 1 positional arguments but 3 were given🔍 **Executing:** extract_text_from_image   → Success: Error: tesseract is not installed or it's not in y...🔍 **Executing:** search_author_military_history   → Success: Error: Unable to extract author's name from the qu...📊 **Registry status:** 4 total tools available✅ mcp_agent completed

🖼️ **Vision enabled:** 1 images detected🧠 **Coordinator:** The query requires extracting text from the image file to identify the book's author and subsequently determine the military unit they joined in 1813. Since the OCR tool failed due to missing dependencies, creating a custom vision analysis tool or resolving the OCR issue is necessary to proceed. Web search or browser automation is premature without identifying the book's author from the image.→ Routing to mcp_agent✅ coordinator completed
🛠️ **MCP Agent:** Analyzing query for tool requirements🖼️ **Vision-enabled analysis:** 1 images detected📋 **Analysis:** The tools are sufficient because the query requires extracting text from the image to identify the book, determining the author of the book, and then finding historical information about the author's military unit in 1813.

🖼️ **Vision enabled:** 1 images detected🧠 **Coordinator:** The query requires extracting text from the image to identify the book and its author. The current OCR tool failed due to a missing dependency (Tesseract). Creating a custom OCR tool or using an alternative vision analysis method is necessary to proceed. This step is critical to identify the book and its author, which will then allow us to determine the military unit the author joined in 1813.→ Routing to mcp_agent✅ coordinator completed
🛠️ **MCP Agent:** Analyzing query for tool requirements🖼️ **Vision-enabled analysis:** 1 images detected📋 **Analysis:** The query requires identifying the book's author or title from the photograph's metadata or image. Once identified, the author's military history must be researched to find the military unit joined in 1813. These tools are sufficient because they address each step of the problem without redundancy.🔧 **Strategy:** sequential execution🛠️ **Tools needed:** 3✅ **Found existing tool:** fetch_museum_metadata✅ **Found existing tool:** extract_text_from_image✅ **Found existing tool:** search_author_military_history⚡ **Executing tools sequentially...**🔍 **Executing:** fetch_museum_metadata   → Failed: fetch_museum_metadata() takes from 0 to 1 positional arguments but 3 were given🔍 **Executing:** extract_text_from_image   → Success: Error: tesseract is not installed or it's not in y...🔍 **Executing:** search_author_military_history   → Success: Error: Unable to extract author's name from the qu...📊 **Registry status:** 5 total tools available✅ mcp_agent completed

📊 **Evaluator:** The query requires identifying the author of the book depicted in the photograph and determining the military unit they joined in 1813. However, we lack critical information such as the author's name and the book title. Attempts to extract text from the image failed due to missing OCR tools, and no metadata or web search results provided relevant details. Without these key pieces of information, we cannot provide a complete answer.
