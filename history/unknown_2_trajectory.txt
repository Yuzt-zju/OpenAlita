Task ID: unknown_2
Question: I have the Standard plan in the image below, and I just uploaded 60 equally sized files and got a message that I'm 100GB over the limit. I have 980 more files of the same size to upload. What is the average additional cost per file in dollar that goes over my current plan limit rounded to the nearest cent if I have to upgrade to the minimum possible plan to store them all? Final answer with the following format: x.xx

Let me think through this step by step:

🖼️ **Vision enabled:** 1 images detected🧠 **Coordinator:** The user query involves calculating the additional cost per file based on the storage plans provided in the image. This requires extracting numerical data from the image (e.g., storage limits and costs) and performing mathematical calculations. Since the image contains structured information, OCR and data extraction are necessary, followed by a custom calculation tool to determine the cost per file. This task does not require interaction or authentication, but it does require vision analysis to extract data from the image.→ Routing to mcp_agent✅ coordinator completed
🛠️ **MCP Agent:** Analyzing query for tool requirements🖼️ **Vision-enabled analysis:** 1 images detected📋 **Analysis:** These tools are sufficient because they address each step of the problem logically and sequentially. First, the plan details are extracted from the image. Then, the file size is calculated based on the overage information. Next, the minimum plan required is determined based on the total storage needed. Finally, the additional cost per file is calculated based on the upgrade cost and total files. Each tool has a clear and distinct purpose, avoiding redundancy.🔧 **Strategy:** sequential execution🛠️ **Tools needed:** 4✅ **Found existing tool:** extract_text_from_image✅ **Found existing tool:** calculate_file_size✅ **Found existing tool:** calculate_additional_cost_per_file🆕 **Creating 1 new tools...**🔧 **Creating:** determine_minimum_plan   ✅ Registered: determine_minimum_plan⚡ **Executing tools sequentially...**🔍 **Executing:** extract_text_from_image   → Success: {'Standard': {'storage_limit_tb': 2, 'price_per_mo...🔍 **Executing:** calculate_file_size   → Failed: calculate_file_size() takes from 0 to 1 positional arguments but 5 were given🔍 **Executing:** determine_minimum_plan   → Success: 0.01...🔍 **Executing:** calculate_additional_cost_per_file   → Failed: calculate_additional_cost_per_file() takes from 0 to 1 positional arguments but 7 were given📊 **Registry status:** 5 total tools available✅ mcp_agent completed

To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Analyze the current plan and storage usage
- **Standard Plan**: 2 TB storage limit at $9.99/month.
- You uploaded 60 files and received a message that you're **100 GB over the limit**. This means the 60 files collectively take up **2.1 TB** (2 TB + 100 GB).

### Step 2: Calculate the size of each file
- Total size of 60 files = 2.1 TB = 2100 GB.
- Size of each file = \( \frac{2100 \, \text{GB}}{60} = 35 \, \text{GB per file} \).

### Step 3: Determine total storage needed for 980 more files
- Each file is 35 GB, so 980 files will require:
  \[
  980 \times 35 \, \text{GB} = 34,300 \, \text{GB} = 34.3 \, \text{TB}.
  \]

- Adding this to the already uploaded 2.1 TB, the total storage needed is:
  \[
  2.1 \, \text{TB} + 34.3 \, \text{TB} = 36.4 \, \text{TB}.
  \]

### Step 4: Determine the minimum plan to accommodate 36.4 TB
- **Standard Plan**: 2 TB (insufficient).
- **Plus Plan**: 10 TB (insufficient).
- **Premium Plan**: 50 TB (sufficient).

Thus, you need to upgrade to the **Premium Plan** at $39.99/month.

### Step 5: Calculate the additional cost
- Current cost (Standard Plan): $9.99/month.
- New cost (Premium Plan): $39.99/month.
- Additional cost per month = \( 39.99 - 9.99 = 30.00 \, \text{USD} \).

### Step 6: Calculate the average additional cost per file
- Total additional cost = $30.00/month.
- Total number of files = 60 (already uploaded) + 980 (new files) = 1040 files.
- Average additional cost per file = \( \frac{30.00}{1040} \approx 0.02885 \, \text{USD} \).
