Task ID: unknown_1
Question: I have the Standard plan in the image below, and I just uploaded 60 equally sized files and got a message that I'm 100GB over the limit. I have 980 more files of the same size to upload. What is the average additional cost per file in dollar that goes over my current plan limit rounded to the nearest cent if I have to upgrade to the minimum possible plan to store them all? Final answer with the following format: x.xx

Let me think through this step by step:

🖼️ **Vision enabled:** 1 images detected🧠 **Coordinator:** The query requires a mathematical calculation to determine the average additional cost per file based on the user's current plan, the file sizes, and the upgrade options available in the image. The image provides the necessary pricing and storage details, which can be extracted and used for the calculation. Since this involves numerical computation and no interaction with a browser or external search is needed, creating a custom tool for the calculation is the most efficient approach.→ Routing to mcp_agent✅ coordinator completed

🖼️ **Vision enabled:** 1 images detected🧠 **Coordinator:** The user's query involves calculating the additional cost per file based on the storage plans provided in the image. The image has already been analyzed, and the relevant data (storage limits and costs) is extracted. However, the calculation of the average additional cost per file requires a custom computational tool to process the data. Since this is a mathematical task, creating a tool for precise calculations is the most appropriate next step.→ Routing to mcp_agent✅ coordinator completed

To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Understand the current situation
- You are on the **Standard plan**, which provides **2 TB of storage**.
- You uploaded **60 files** and received a message that you're **100 GB over the limit**. This means the **60 files** collectively take up **2.1 TB** of storage (2 TB + 100 GB = 2.1 TB).

### Step 2: Calculate the size of each file
- The total size of the 60 files is **2.1 TB**, which is equivalent to **2,100 GB**.
- The size of each file is:
  \[
  \text{File size} = \frac{\text{Total size}}{\text{Number of files}} = \frac{2,100 \, \text{GB}}{60} = 35 \, \text{GB per file}.
  \]

### Step 3: Determine the total storage needed for all files
- You have already uploaded **60 files** and plan to upload **980 more files**.
- The total number of files is:
  \[
  60 + 980 = 1,040 \, \text{files}.
  \]
- The total storage required is:
  \[
  \text{Total storage} = 1,040 \times 35 \, \text{GB} = 36,400 \, \text{GB} = 36.4 \, \text{TB}.
  \]

### Step 4: Identify the minimum plan required
- The **Standard plan** provides **2 TB**, which is insufficient.
- The **Plus plan** provides **10 TB**, which is also insufficient.
- The **Premium plan** provides **50 TB**, which is sufficient to store **36.4 TB** of data.

### Step 5: Calculate the additional cost
- The **Standard plan** costs **$9.99/month**.
- The **Premium plan** costs **$39.99/month**.
- The additional cost per month is:
  \[
  \text{Additional cost} = 39.99 - 9.99 = 30.00 \, \text{USD/month}.
  \]

### Step 6: Calculate the average additional cost per file
- The additional cost per file is:
  \[
  \text{Additional cost per file} = \frac{\text{Additional cost per month}}{\text{Total number of files}} = \frac{30.00}{1,040} \approx 0.02885 \, \text{USD}.
  \]
- Rounded to the nearest cent:
  \[
  \text{Additional cost per file} = 0.03 \, \text{USD}.
  \]
