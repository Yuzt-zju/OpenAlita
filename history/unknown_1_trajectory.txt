Task ID: unknown_1
Question: I have the Standard plan in the image below, and I just uploaded 60 equally sized files and got a message that I'm 100GB over the limit. I have 980 more files of the same size to upload. What is the average additional cost per file in dollar that goes over my current plan limit rounded to the nearest cent if I have to upgrade to the minimum possible plan to store them all? Final answer with the following format: x.xx

Let me think through this step by step:

🖼️ **Vision enabled:** 1 images detected🧠 **Coordinator:** The query involves calculating the average additional cost per file based on the user's current plan, the file sizes, and the upgrade options shown in the image. This requires extracting numerical data from the image (e.g., storage limits and costs) and performing mathematical calculations. Since the image contains structured information, OCR and mathematical analysis tools are needed to extract and process the data accurately.→ Routing to mcp_agent✅ coordinator completed

To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Analyze the current plan and usage
- **Standard Plan**: 2 TB storage limit, $9.99/month.
- You uploaded 60 files and exceeded the limit by **100 GB**. This means the 60 files collectively take up **2 TB + 100 GB = 2.1 TB**.

### Step 2: Calculate the size of each file
- Total size of 60 files = 2.1 TB = 2100 GB.
- Size of each file = \( \frac{2100 \, \text{GB}}{60} = 35 \, \text{GB per file} \).

### Step 3: Determine the total storage needed for all files
- You have 980 more files to upload, and each file is 35 GB.
- Total size of 980 files = \( 980 \times 35 = 34300 \, \text{GB} = 34.3 \, \text{TB} \).
- Total storage needed = \( 2.1 \, \text{TB (already uploaded)} + 34.3 \, \text{TB} = 36.4 \, \text{TB} \).

### Step 4: Determine the minimum plan required
- The **Plus Plan** offers 10 TB for $19.99/month.
- The **Premium Plan** offers 50 TB for $39.99/month.
- Since 36.4 TB exceeds the Plus Plan's 10 TB limit, you need the **Premium Plan**.

### Step 5: Calculate the additional cost
- Current cost (Standard Plan) = $9.99/month.
- New cost (Premium Plan) = $39.99/month.
- Additional cost = \( 39.99 - 9.99 = 30.00 \, \text{USD/month} \).

### Step 6: Calculate the average additional cost per file
- Total number of files = \( 60 + 980 = 1040 \).
- Average additional cost per file = \( \frac{30.00}{1040} = 0.02885 \, \text{USD} \).
- Rounded to the nearest cent = **0.03**.
