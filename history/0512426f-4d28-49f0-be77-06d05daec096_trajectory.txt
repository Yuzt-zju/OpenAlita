Level: 3

Let me think through this step by step:

🌐 **Coordinator:** The user query specifically references a YouTube 360 VR video, which requires accessing and interacting with the video content to locate the specific moment when dinosaurs are first shown and identify the number mentioned by the narrator. This task involves dynamic content and visual interaction, which falls under the criteria for browser automation. Web search is not sufficient because the query is highly specific and unlikely to yield direct results without watching the video. No local image files or vision analysis tools are required at this stage, as the task is focused on video content.🤖 **Browser Capabilities:** Video Content, Dynamic Content, Visual Tasks→ Routing to browser automation✅ coordinator completed
