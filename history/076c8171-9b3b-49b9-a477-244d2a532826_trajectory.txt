🧠 **Coordinator:** The task requires analyzing the provided file content to calculate the vendor with the least revenue-to-rent ratio. This involves mathematical computations and data processing, which can be efficiently handled by creating a custom tool. The information is already available in the file content, so no additional web search or browser interaction is necessary. Vision analysis is not required as the data is presented in text format.→ Routing to mcp_agent✅ coordinator completed
