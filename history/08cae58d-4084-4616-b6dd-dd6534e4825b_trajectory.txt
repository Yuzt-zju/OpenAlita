Level: 2

Let me think through this step by step:

🧠 **Coordinator:** The user query requires historical data about Apple stock prices, specifically the first year it went above $50 without adjusting for stock splits. This information is likely available on static content websites or financial databases. Since no web search results have been gathered yet, a targeted web search is the most appropriate next step to locate this information. Browser automation is not necessary as the task does not involve dynamic content or interaction, and no custom tools are required at this stage.🎯 **Strategy:** targeted search💡 **Missing:** Historical stock price data for Apple, specifically the first year it exceeded $50 unadjusted for stock splits.→ Routing to web_agent✅ coordinator completed
