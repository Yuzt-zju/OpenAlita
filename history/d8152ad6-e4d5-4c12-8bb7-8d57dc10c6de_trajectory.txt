Question: I have the Standard plan in the image below, and I just uploaded 60 equally sized files and got a message that I'm 100GB over the limit. I have 980 more files of the same size to upload. What is the average additional cost per file in dollar that goes over my current plan limit rounded to the nearest cent if I have to upgrade to the minimum possible plan to store them all? Answer with the following format: x.xx

To answer the question, let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Determine the size of each file
- You uploaded 60 files and exceeded your 2 TB limit by 100 GB.
- Therefore, the total size of the 60 files is **2 TB + 100 GB = 2100 GB**.
- The size of each file is:  
  \( \text{File size} = \frac{2100 \, \text{GB}}{60} = 35 \, \text{GB per file} \).

### Step 2: Calculate the total storage needed for 980 more files
- Each file is 35 GB, so the total size of 980 files is:  
  \( 980 \times 35 \, \text{GB} = 34,300 \, \text{GB} = 34.3 \, \text{TB} \).

### Step 3: Calculate the total storage needed overall
- You already uploaded 60 files (2.1 TB), and you plan to upload 980 more files (34.3 TB).  
  Total storage needed = \( 2.1 \, \text{TB} + 34.3 \, \text{TB} = 36.4 \, \text{TB} \).

### Step 4: Determine the minimum plan to accommodate 36.4 TB
- The **Standard plan** provides 2 TB, which is insufficient.
- The **Plus plan** provides 10 TB, which is also insufficient.
- The **Premium plan** provides 50 TB, which is sufficient.

### Step 5: Calculate the additional cost
- The **Standard plan** costs $9.99/month.
- The **Premium plan** costs $39.99/month.
- The additional cost is:  
  \( 39.99 - 9.99 = 30.00 \, \text{USD/month} \).

### Step 6: Calculate the average additional cost per file
- You are uploading 980 files, so the average additional cost per file is:  
  \( \frac{30.00}{980} = 0.03061 \, \text{USD per file} \).
- Rounded to the nearest cent: **0.03**.

To answer the question, let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Understand the current situation
- You are on the **Standard plan**, which has a **2 TB storage limit**.
- You uploaded **60 files** and received a message that you're **100 GB over the limit**. This means the 60 files collectively take up **2.1 TB** of storage (2 TB + 100 GB = 2.1 TB).

### Step 2: Calculate the size of each file
- The total size of the 60 files is **2.1 TB**, which is equivalent to **2,100 GB**.
- The size of each file is:
  \[
  \text{File size} = \frac{\text{Total size}}{\text{Number of files}} = \frac{2,100 \, \text{GB}}{60} = 35 \, \text{GB per file}.
  \]

### Step 3: Determine the total storage needed for all files
- You have already uploaded 60 files and plan to upload **980 more files**.
- The total number of files is:
  \[
  60 + 980 = 1,040 \, \text{files}.
  \]
- The total storage required is:
  \[
  \text{Total storage} = \text{Number of files} \times \text{File size} = 1,040 \times 35 \, \text{GB} = 36,400 \, \text{GB}.
  \]
- Convert this to terabytes (TB):
  \[
  36,400 \, \text{GB} = 36.4 \, \text{TB}.
  \]

### Step 4: Determine the minimum plan required
- The **Standard plan** (2 TB) is insufficient.
- The **Plus plan** (10 TB) is also insufficient.
- The **Premium plan** (50 TB) is sufficient because it exceeds the required 36.4 TB.

### Step 5: Calculate the additional cost
- The **Standard plan** costs **$9.99/month**.
- The **Premium plan** costs **$39.99/month**.
- The additional cost per month is:
  \[
  \text{Additional cost} = 39.99 - 9.99 = 30.00 \, \text{USD}.
  \]
- The additional cost per file is:
  \[
  \text{Additional cost per file} = \frac{\text{Additional cost}}{\text{Number of files}} = \frac{30.00}{1,040} \approx 0.03 \, \text{USD per file}.
  \]
