🧠 **Coordinator:** The task requires identifying specific paintings in the Smithsonian American Art Museum's collection that are linked to 'The Nature of Desire' and determining the chapter numbers referenced in their titles. Previous attempts to use the Smithsonian API and direct searches have not yielded results due to technical issues and lack of specific data. A targeted web search focusing on academic articles, museum catalogs, or art reviews might provide the necessary information. This approach avoids the technical barriers encountered with the API and leverages broader online resources.🎯 **Strategy:** targeted search💡 **Missing:** Specific titles of paintings in the Smithsonian collection linked to 'The Nature of Desire' and the chapter numbers they reference.→ Routing to web_agent✅ coordinator completed
