Task ID: 2b3ef98c-cc05-450b-a719-711aee40ac65
Question: Could you help me out with this assignment? Our professor sprung it on us at the end of class Friday, and I'm still trying to figure it out. The question he asked us was about an anagram. I've attached an audio recording of the question that he asked, so if you could please take a listen and give me the answer, I'd really appreciate the help. Please limit your response to the anagram text that could be generated from the original line which fulfills the professor's request, without any other commentary. Also, please don't include any punctuation in your response.

Let me think through this step by step:

🧠 **Coordinator:** The user has provided an audio recording of the professor's question, which likely contains the text needed to generate the anagram. Since no image or text file is provided, and the task involves processing audio to extract text, a custom tool for audio transcription (speech-to-text) is required. This will allow us to analyze the professor's question and generate the requested anagram. None of the other agents are equipped to directly handle audio transcription in this context.→ Routing to mcp_agent✅ coordinator completed
🛠️ **MCP Agent:** Analyzing query for tool requirements📋 **Analysis:** The first tool is needed to transcribe the audio recording into text so that the professor's question can be understood. The second tool is required to generate the anagram from the transcribed text. These tools are sufficient because they directly address the user's query without introducing unnecessary complexity or redundancy.🔧 **Strategy:** sequential execution🛠️ **Tools needed:** 2✅ **Found existing tool:** transcribe_audio✅ **Found existing tool:** generate_anagram⚡ **Executing tools sequentially...**🔍 **Executing:** transcribe_audio   → Failed: transcribe_audio() takes from 0 to 1 positional arguments but 2 were given🔍 **Executing:** generate_anagram   → Success: nteomripsttrgrao,tuhretemaciIfnlhcnmehhkresemteotP...📊 **Registry status:** 2 total tools available✅ mcp_agent completed
