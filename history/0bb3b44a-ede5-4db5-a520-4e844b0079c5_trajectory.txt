🎨 **Synthesizer:** Creating final answer...
The Babylonian number system operates on a sexagesimal (base-60) positional numeral system. To convert the given symbols into Arabic numerals:

1. **Symbol Analysis**:
   - The symbol **𒐜** represents the value **60** in the Babylonian system.
   - The combination **𒐐𒐚** represents **12**.

2. **Conversion**:
   - In the Babylonian system, numbers are calculated by summing multiples of powers of 60 based on the positional arrangement of symbols.
   - Here, the number is **60 + 12**.

3. **Result**:
   - The decimal equivalent of the given Babylonian number is **72**.

Thus, the number represented by the symbols **𒐜 𒐐𒐚** in the Babylonian system is **72** in Arabic numerals.✅ synthesizer completed
