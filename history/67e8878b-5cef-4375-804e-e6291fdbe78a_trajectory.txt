Let me think through this step by step:

🧠 **Coordinator:** The user query involves analyzing the attached PDF to determine the average ratings of different types of accommodations in Seahorse Island. Since no web search results or prior tool results are available, and the PDF is not directly analyzed yet, creating a custom tool for OCR (to extract text from the PDF) and data processing (to calculate average ratings) is the most appropriate next step. This approach ensures we can extract and process the necessary information directly from the provided file.→ Routing to mcp_agent✅ coordinator completed
🛠️ **MCP Agent:** Analyzing query for tool requirements📋 **Analysis:** The problem requires extracting data from a PDF, structuring it to identify accommodation types and their ratings, and then calculating the average rating for each type. These three tools are sufficient and non-redundant, as each has a clear and distinct purpose. The sequential execution ensures that the output of one tool feeds into the next.🔧 **Strategy:** sequential execution🛠️ **Tools needed:** 3✅ **Found existing tool:** extract_text_from_pdf✅ **Found existing tool:** parse_accommodation_data✅ **Found existing tool:** calculate_average_rating⚡ **Executing tools sequentially...**🔍 **Executing:** extract_text_from_pdf   → Success: Error: 'str' object has no attribute 'get'...🔍 **Executing:** parse_accommodation_data   → Success: Error: 'str' object has no attribute 'get'...🔍 **Executing:** calculate_average_rating   → Success: Error: 'str' object has no attribute 'get'...📊 **Registry status:** 3 total tools available✅ mcp_agent completed

🧠 **Coordinator:** The user query requires analyzing the attached PDF to determine the average ratings of different types of accommodations. Previous attempts to extract and parse data from the PDF failed due to errors. Since the task involves processing a PDF file and extracting structured data, creating or refining custom tools for text extraction and data parsing is the most appropriate next step. This approach ensures we can directly analyze the content of the PDF to address the user's query.→ Routing to mcp_agent✅ coordinator completed

🧠 **Coordinator:** The user query requires analyzing the attached PDF to extract accommodation data and calculate average ratings. Previous attempts to extract and parse the data from the PDF failed due to errors. Creating a custom tool to handle the PDF extraction and parsing more robustly is the most logical next step. This approach avoids unnecessary web searches or browser automation, as the required information is already contained within the PDF.→ Routing to mcp_agent✅ coordinator completed

🧠 **Coordinator:** The user query requires analyzing the attached PDF to extract accommodation data and calculate average ratings. Previous attempts to extract and parse the data from the PDF failed due to errors ('str' object has no attribute 'get'). This suggests that the tools used were not properly configured or the input format was not handled correctly. Creating a new, robust tool to extract and process the data from the PDF is the most appropriate next step. Since no web search results or external data are needed, and the task does not involve dynamic content or interaction, browser automation is unnecessary. Synthesis cannot proceed without successfully extracting and analyzing the data.→ Routing to mcp_agent✅ coordinator completed

📊 **Evaluator:** The available tools and methods failed to extract or parse the necessary data from the attached PDF. Without the extracted text, parsed accommodation data, or calculated average ratings, we cannot determine which type of accommodation has a higher average rating in Seahorse Island. Additional attempts to gather or process the information are required.
