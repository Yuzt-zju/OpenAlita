Task ID: unknown_1
Question: I have the Standard plan in the image below, and I just uploaded 60 equally sized files and got a message that I'm 100GB over the limit. I have 980 more files of the same size to upload. What is the average additional cost per file in dollar that goes over my current plan limit rounded to the nearest cent if I have to upgrade to the minimum possible plan to store them all? Final answer with the following format: x.xx

Let me think through this step by step:

🖼️ **Vision enabled:** 1 images detected🧠 **Coordinator:** The query involves calculating the additional cost per file based on the user's current plan, the size of the files, and the cost of upgrading to the minimum plan that accommodates all files. The image provides the pricing and storage details for the plans, which can be extracted using vision analysis. A custom tool is needed to perform the calculations after extracting the relevant data from the image.→ Routing to mcp_agent✅ coordinator completed

To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Understand the current situation
- You are on the **Standard plan**, which provides **2 TB of storage** for **$9.99/month**.
- You uploaded **60 files** and received a message that you're **100 GB over the limit**. This means the **60 files collectively occupy 2.1 TB** (2 TB + 100 GB).

### Step 2: Calculate the size of each file
- The total size of the 60 files is **100 GB over the 2 TB limit**, so the total size is **2.1 TB = 2,100 GB**.
- The size of each file is:  
  \[
  \text{File size} = \frac{\text{Total size of 60 files}}{\text{Number of files}} = \frac{2,100 \, \text{GB}}{60} = 35 \, \text{GB per file}.
  \]

### Step 3: Determine the total storage required for all files
- You have already uploaded **60 files** and plan to upload **980 more files**.  
  Total number of files = \( 60 + 980 = 1,040 \).
- Total storage required:  
  \[
  \text{Total storage} = \text{Number of files} \times \text{File size} = 1,040 \times 35 \, \text{GB} = 36,400 \, \text{GB} = 36.4 \, \text{TB}.
  \]

### Step 4: Determine the minimum plan required
- The **Standard plan** provides **2 TB**, which is insufficient.
- The **Plus plan** provides **10 TB**, which is also insufficient.
- The **Premium plan** provides **50 TB**, which is sufficient.

### Step 5: Calculate the additional cost
- The **Premium plan** costs **$39.99/month**, while the **Standard plan** costs **$9.99/month**.
- Additional monthly cost:  
  \[
  \text{Additional cost} = 39.99 - 9.99 = 30.00 \, \text{USD/month}.
  \]
- The additional cost per file:  
  \[
  \text{Cost per file} = \frac{\text{Additional cost}}{\text{Number of files}} = \frac{30.00}{1,040} \approx 0.03 \, \text{USD per file}.
  \]

To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Understand the current situation
- **Current plan**: Standard ($9.99/month) with **2 TB storage**.
- **Files uploaded**: 60 files caused the user to exceed the limit by **100 GB**.
- **File size**: Each file is equally sized. Therefore, the size of each file is:
  \[
  \text{File size} = \frac{100 \, \text{GB}}{60} = 1.67 \, \text{GB (approx.)}.
  \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total storage needed
- **Total files to upload**: 980 more files.
- **Total storage required for 980 files**:
  \[
  980 \times 1.67 \, \text{GB} = 1636.6 \, \text{GB (approx.)}.
  \]
- **Total storage required (including the 60 files already uploaded)**:
  \[
  1636.6 \, \text{GB} + 100 \, \text{GB} = 1736.6 \, \text{GB}.
  \]
  This is approximately **1.74 TB**.

### Step 3: Determine the required plan
- The **Standard plan** has a limit of 2 TB, which is sufficient for the current files. However, the user is already **100 GB over the limit**, so they need to upgrade.
- The **Plus plan** ($19.99/month) offers **10 TB storage**, which is the minimum plan that can accommodate all files.

### Step 4: Calculate the additional cost
- **Cost difference between Standard and Plus plans**:
  \[
  19.99 - 9.99 = 10.00 \, \text{USD/month}.
  \]
- **Additional cost per file**:
  \[
  \frac{10.00}{980} = 0.0102 \, \text{USD/file}.
  \]
  Rounded to the nearest cent:
  \[
  0.01 \, \text{USD/file}.
  \]
