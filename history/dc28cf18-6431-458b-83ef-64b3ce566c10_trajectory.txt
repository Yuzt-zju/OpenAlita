Question: My family reunion is this week, and I was assigned the mashed potatoes to bring. The attendees include my married mother and father, my twin brother and his family, my aunt and her family, my grandma and her brother, her brother's daughter, and his daughter's family. All the adults but me have been married, and no one is divorced or remarried, but my grandpa and my grandma's sister-in-law passed away last year. All living spouses are attending. My brother has two children that are still kids, my aunt has one six-year-old, and my grandma's brother's daughter has three kids under 12. I figure each adult will eat about 1.5 potatoes of mashed potatoes and each kid will eat about 1/2 a potato of mashed potatoes, except my second cousins don't eat carbs. The average potato is about half a pound, and potatoes are sold in 5-pound bags. How many whole bags of potatoes do I need? Just give the number.
Level: 1

Let me think through this step by step:

🧠 **Coordinator:** The user's query involves a detailed mathematical calculation to determine the number of potato bags required. This calculation includes counting attendees, categorizing them into adults and children, accounting for dietary restrictions, and converting the total potato weight into the number of 5-pound bags. This task is best handled by creating a custom tool or function to perform the necessary computations accurately.→ Routing to mcp_agent✅ coordinator completed

To calculate the number of 5-pound bags of potatoes you need:

1. **Count the attendees:**
   - Adults: Your parents (2), you (1), your twin brother and his spouse (2), your aunt and her spouse (2), your grandma (1), her brother (1), and his daughter and her spouse (2). Total adults = 11.
   - Kids: Your brother's 2 kids (2), your aunt's 6-year-old (1), and your grandma's brother's daughter's 3 kids (3). Total kids = 6.
   - Note: The 3 kids (your second cousins) don’t eat carbs, so they won’t count toward the potato calculation.

2. **Potato consumption:**
   - Adults: 11 adults × 1.5 potatoes = 16.5 potatoes.
   - Kids (excluding the 3 second cousins): 3 kids × 0.5 potatoes = 1.5 potatoes.
   - Total potatoes needed = 16.5 + 1.5 = 18 potatoes.

3. **Convert to pounds:**
   - 18 potatoes × 0.5 pounds per potato = 9 pounds.

4. **Determine the number of bags:**
   - Potatoes are sold in 5-pound bags. 9 pounds ÷ 5 pounds per bag = 1.8 bags.
   - You’ll need to round up to the nearest whole bag, so you need **2 bags**.

**Final Answer: 2 bags of potatoes.**✅ synthesizer completed
